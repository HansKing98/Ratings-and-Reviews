        "The large fits very well. A little looser in the waist than I'd prefer but that's a common problem for my body type and this isn't too bad and still wearable. Stitching/zippers/snaps all feel strong and not a single loose thread. Has one inside breast pocket and snaps for the waist pockets. I've included a picture which shows the jacket open and closed with and without a hoodie underneath. Shoulders fit better than the pictures suggest; think the act of taking the picture threw it off I guess. We'll see how this thing fares through the winter; I plan on wearing it a lot.",
